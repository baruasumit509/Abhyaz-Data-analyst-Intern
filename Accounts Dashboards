Problem Statement - >

  (1)Higher Management/Stakeholder wants to know in Accounts Dashboard which accounts mapping member has mapped the accounts.

 (2) It is showing us the id, but not the name of the member.

 (3)  After accounts have been mapped it is consuming time to do the manual process. (I have to check with the account mapping Team who have mapped the check-in CRM and tables to verify). This process takes time and has sometimes led to errors.

 (4)  As a data analyst, my task was to automate the manual process and come up with solution.
   
   Solution ->
   
   
    (1) Refer to the Zoho CRM, where accounts have been mapped.

 (2) Understand the ERD Diagram, through which you can understand the connection of the tables.

 (3) In the table there is an option to connect multiple tables, through which I was able to solve the issue.

 (4) This led to increased productivity and fewer errors, resulting in a 30% reduction in overall time.
